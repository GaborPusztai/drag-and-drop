ZTM - Course project </br>
A drag-and-drop JavaScript application allows users to interact with elements on a webpage by dragging them from one location and dropping them into another. This functionality is typically achieved using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API or JavaScript libraries like React. Itâ€™s commonly used for tasks such as rearranging items in a list, uploading files, or creating dynamic layouts in web applications. The app captures drag events (e.g., dragstart, dragover, drop) to manage the visual and functional behavior of the draggable elements.
